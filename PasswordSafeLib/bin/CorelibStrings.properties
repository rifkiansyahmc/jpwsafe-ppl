# This file provides the default messages where there is no localised version
# available.  The locale for this file is en_GB - i.e. all spellings in this
# file should be the British English version (e.g. colour rather than color).
# Language usage should also be the British variant (e.g. pavement rather than
# sidewalk).
#
# If you want spelling and phrasing for alternative variants of English, treat
# them as a translation.  Copy this file giving the new file the same name but
# with the appropriate locale suffix (e.g. CorelibStrings_en_US.properties).
# Then edit that file changing spelling and phrasing as necessary.  Put the new
# file in the same location as this one.
#
# Any message that is presented to the user must be in this file, unless they
# are only issued through log4j AND they have a level of DEBUG.
