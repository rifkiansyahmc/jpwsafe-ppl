Introduction:
=============
Password Safe SWT is a password database utility. Like many other such
products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an
encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "safe
combination"), instead of all the username/password combinations that
you use. Password Safe SWT is a java clone of
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net

What makes Password Safe different? Three things:
1. Simplicity: Password Safe is designed to do one thing, and to do it
well. Start the application, enter your "combination", double-click on
the right entry - presto - the password is now on your clipboard,ready
for pasting.
2. Security: The original version was designed and written by Bruce
Schneier - 'nuff said.
3. Open Source: The source code for the project is available for
inspection. For more information, see http://jpwsafe.sourceforge.net

Password Safe SWT currently runs on Windows 2000, XP and Vista, Mac OS X
and Linux (x86 and x86_64). Support for additional platforms
is planned for future releases. 

How to Build
============
This is the Eclipse project for the SWT Gui for PasswordSafe, 
Eclipse 3.4 is recommmended.

In order to compile in Eclipse, you need to satisfy two project dependencies: 
org.eclipse.swt and PasswordSafeLib

For a howto for the org.eclipse.swt project, see http://www.eclipse.org/swt/eclipse.php
In short, download the swt.zip for your platform and import it as a project into eclipse.

to get PasswordSafeLib, create a new eclipse project "Checkout projects from svn",
choose http(s)://jpwsafe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jpwsafe as a repository and 
navigate to /trunk/PasswordSafeLib.
Alternatively, modify your build path to use the passwordsafelib.jar instead.
